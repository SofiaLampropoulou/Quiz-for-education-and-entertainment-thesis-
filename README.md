Web Application for Creating Quiz Games.
Quiz games are a form of entertainment or mental exercise in which players are asked to answer a series of questions on one or more topics. Quizzes are commonly used in education or similar fields to assess knowledge or measure development in knowledge, skills, or abilities. They can also be broadcasted on television for entertainment purposes, often in the form of game shows.

Within the scope of this thesis, the following are requested:

a)Study and critical review of the existing literature.
b)Development of a web-based digital application for creating multiple-choice quiz questions, which will support the following functionalities. There will be two types of users, those who will create/post the quiz (authors) and those who will answer the questions (test-takers). Authors should be able to log in using credentials and should be able to create quizzes, and assign the quiz's answer by sending a number or hyperlink. Test-takers should be able to log in to the quiz using the number or hyperlink and answer the questions. Test-takers should be able to see which questions they answered incorrectly and what the correct answer was. The quiz should only be executable (answerable) when it is active, and there should be the ability to customize it in terms of total time and the time for each question available to the test-taker. Finally, the quizzes posted by each author should be displayed in a list, and from there, it should be possible to select which one will be active or inactive. Additionally, the author should be able to view statistics for each quiz and question and select the time when the quiz will be active and when it will not.
